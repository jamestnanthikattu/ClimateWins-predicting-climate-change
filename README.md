# ClimateWins: Predicting Climate Change with Machine Learning

## About This Project

The goal is to:
- Spot strange weather happening in Europe
- See if these strange events are increasing
- Predict weather patterns over the next 25â€“50 years
- Identify safe places to live in Europe based on climate data

---

## Key Tools Used

### âœ… Machine Learning Models:
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Groups similar weather data together.
- **Random Forest**: Uses many decision trees to make better predictions.
- **GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)**: Creates fake but realistic weather data.
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**: Analyzes radar images to help predict weather.

### ðŸ“Š Data Sources:
- Weather event records (storms, heat, cold)
- Radar images
- Health data (injuries, illness from extreme weather)
- Lists of dangerous weather types
